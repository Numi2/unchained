Unchained, a permissionless blockchain. Time is divided into 222s epochs; miners submit coin candidates throughout an epoch using Argon2id. At the end of an epoch, the network finalizes an anchor that commits to up to x nr selected coins via a Merkle root, enabling independent verification and efficient synchronization. 

Ownership is tracked with Dilithium3 signatures; receivers obtain privacy via Kyber768-based stealth receiving with one-time keys. Unchained uses libp2p (quantum prefer branch) over QUIC for gossip

Post‑quantum blockchain implementation - Dilithium3 for signatures, Kyber768 for stealth receiving, BLAKE3 for hashing, Argon2id for PoW. libp2p over QUIC does the gossip (libp2p prefer pq aws). 

- Memory‑hard PoW  Argon2id; David balanced to Goliath
- End‑to‑end PQ: Dilithium3 signatures, Kyber768 for stealth, BLAKE3 throughout the merkles
- rocksdb

Double‑spend protection uses nullifiers derived from transaction‑local secrets bound to each coin id. Validators reject any repeated nullifier.

## Quick start


```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run --release --bin unchained mine
```

What happens on first run:
- A wallet is created and encrypted with your passphrase
- A persistent P2P identity is generated (`peer_identity.key`)
- The node syncs, then starts mining (if enabled in `config.toml`)

Stop with Ctrl+C.

### Show your Peer ID (for peering/firewall rules)

```bash
cargo run --release --bin unchained -- peer-id
```

If `net.public_ip` is set in `config.toml`, you’ll also see your full multiaddr for others to dial.

## CLI (no surprises)

All commands accept `--config <path>` (default `config.toml`) and `--quiet-net`.

- `mine` — start mining immediately (overrides `mining.enabled`)
- `peer-id` — print local libp2p Peer ID (and multiaddr if `net.public_ip` is set)
- `stealth-address` — print your stealth receiving address (base64-url)
- `proof --coin-id <HEX>` — request and verify a Merkle proof for a coin
- `proof-server [--bind HOST:PORT]` — HTTPS server that returns proofs
- `send --stealth <ADDRESS> --amount <N>` — send to a stealth address
- `balance` — show wallet balance + address
- `history` — print simple tx history

Examples:

```bash
# Send 1 coin to a recipient’s stealth address (base64‑url string)
cargo run --release --bin unchained send --stealth <STEALTH_ADDR> --amount 1
```

What to expect when sending to a stealth address:
- The wallet constructs a private output for the recipient using Kyber768 and BLAKE3.
- The spend is authorized without exposing long signatures in the transaction body.
- The coin always leaves the sender’s balance and, once gossiped and validated, arrives in the recipient’s balance.
- Inclusion is proven to anyone via a Merkle proof against the epoch anchor.

If you paste a stealth address with or without an embedded signature, the node accepts it; the receiver’s public keys are what matter for deriving the output.

## Configuration (edit `config.toml`)

- `[net]`: P2P port, bootstrap peers, optional `public_ip` (for NAT)
- `[p2p]`: rate limits and ban windows for chatty/bad peers
- `[storage]`: database path
- `[epoch]`: epoch length, difficulty bounds, retarget tuning
- `[mining]`: Argon2id memory bounds, attempts, workers, offload
- `[metrics]`: Prometheus bind address

Notes:
- If `storage.path` is relative, the node stores data under `~/.unchained/unchained_data`
- The shipped `config.toml` is a decent starting point

## Wallet and security

- Dilithium3 wallet keys are encrypted at rest with XChaCha20‑Poly1305
- Keys come from your passphrase via Argon2id (large memory, slow to brute‑force)
- Stealth receiving uses Kyber768. The receiver derives a one‑time key deterministically from the encapsulated secret, the receiver’s public key and chain context.
- Merkle roots per epoch let you prove a coin was included without scanning the whole chain.

### Balances and transfers

- Your wallet’s balance is the sum of coins that you currently control.
- When you send, selected coins are spent and leave your balance immediately upon validation.
- The recipient’s wallet will detect the incoming stealth output deterministically and the coin will appear in their balance.
- The network enforces uniqueness of spends via nullifiers and Merkle proofs.

## Stealth receiving (how to get paid privately)

1) Export your stealth address (a signed bundle that binds your normal address to your Kyber768 public key):

```bash
cargo run --release --bin unchained -- stealth-address
```

Share this base64‑url string with senders. They’ll encrypt a one‑time Dilithium key to your Kyber PK. Your wallet can decrypt it, nobody else can.

2) Senders use the CLI:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin unchained -- send --stealth <STEALTH_ADDR> --amount 1
```

The wallet will:
- Use V2 spends (Merkle‑anchored, blinded nullifier) for all transfers

## V2 spend (PQ and practical)

Fields:
- `coin_id` — 32 bytes
- `root` — epoch Merkle root
- `proof` — inclusion proof for `coin_id` leaf
- `to` — stealth output `{ one_time_pk, kyber_ct, enc_one_time_sk, enc_sk_nonce }`
- `commitment` — BLAKE3(to.canonical_bytes())
- `nullifier` — BLAKE3("nullifier_v2" || spend_sk || coin_id)
- `sig` — Dilithium3 over `auth_bytes`

Authorization bytes: `auth_bytes = root || nullifier || commitment || coin_id`

Node checks:
1) Coin exists and the epoch anchor matches `root`
2) Merkle proof verifies
3) Nullifier hasn’t been seen
4) Signature verifies under current owner’s one‑time Dilithium public key

## Network and protocol

- Transport: QUIC over UDP (libp2p)
- Gossip: gossipsub topics (anchors, coins, transfers, spends, proofs)
- TLS: rustls + aws‑lc‑rs; prefers PQ/hybrid TLS 1.3

Peer identity lives in `peer_identity.key`. Keep it if you want a stable Peer ID.

## Proof server (HTTPS)

Run a local HTTPS endpoint to fetch proofs by coin id:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin unchained -- proof-server --bind 127.0.0.1:9090
```

Optional auth: set `PROOF_SERVER_TOKEN` and send `x-auth-token` header.

Example request:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: $PROOF_SERVER_TOKEN" \
  https://127.0.0.1:9090/proof/<COIN_ID_HEX> | jq .
```

Response (example):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "response": {
    "coin": "…",
    "epoch": 123,
    "merkle_root": "…",
    "proof_len": 17
  }
}
```


Notables: `unchained_peer_count`, `unchained_epoch_height`, `unchained_selected_coins`, `unchained_coin_proofs_served_total`, `unchained_mining_*`.

## Data storage

- RocksDB column families: `epoch`, `coin`, `coin_candidate`, `anchor`, `transfer`, `spend`, `nullifier`, …
- Optional coin mirroring: `<db>/coins/coin-<id>.bin` (set `COIN_MIRRORING=0` to disable)
- Simple backups: `<db>/backups/<timestamp>/`

## Mining and epochs (how blocks happen)

- Time is chunked into epochs (`[epoch].seconds`)
- Miners produce coin candidates by meeting Argon2id difficulty
- Each epoch selects up to `[epoch].max_coins_per_epoch` (best PoW) and commits IDs into a Merkle root
- Difficulty and Argon2 memory adjust to aim for `[epoch].target_coins_per_epoch`

## Troubleshooting

- DB locked: don’t share `storage.path` across processes; only delete `LOCK` if the node is stopped
- No peers: add at least one good `[net].bootstrap` multiaddr; open the UDP port or set `public_ip`
- NAT: forward UDP `listen_port`; set `public_ip`
- Non‑interactive: export `WALLET_PASSPHRASE`
- Metrics port busy: it will try the next port; check logs for the new bind
- Too chatty: pass `--quiet-net`

## What makes it post‑quantum?

- Dilithium3 for signatures and addresses (no classical curves)
- Kyber768 for KEM (stealth receiving without leaking long‑term keys)
- BLAKE3 + Argon2id (fast, modern, and not obviously broken by near‑term quantum)

Net effect: you run a normal node and use normal commands, but the cryptography underneath is built for the long haul.

### Scope
I reviewed all modules in `src/` with focus on PoW, epoch coin selection, coin/transfer data models, stealth addresses, and consensus/networking behavior.

### Core design overview
- PoW is per-coin, not per-block: miners search nonces over a header composed of `(prev epoch hash || nonce || creator_address)`, compute Argon2id with fixed lanes=1 and a BLAKE3-derived salt, and submit solutions as coin candidates. Epochs (anchors) are time-based and select the best coins from the previous epoch’s candidates.
- Anchors carry the epoch’s coin commitments (Merkle root) and policy parameters (`difficulty`, `mem_kib`), plus a cumulative_work counter used to choose the best chain.

### Proof-of-Work details
- Hash function:
```74:89:/Users/numan/unchained/src/crypto.rs
pub fn argon2id_pow(input: &[u8], mem_kib: u32) -> Result<[u8; 32]> {
    // lanes fixed to 1 as per consensus rules
    let params = Params::new(mem_kib, 1, 1, None)
        .map_err(|e| anyhow!("Invalid Argon2id parameters: {}", e))?;
    let a2 = Argon2::new(Algorithm::Argon2id, Version::V0x13, params);
    let mut hash = [0u8; 32];
    // Unkeyed BLAKE3 over header bytes; first 16 bytes as salt
    let full_salt = blake3::hash(input);
    let salt = &full_salt.as_bytes()[..16];

    a2.hash_password_into(input, salt, &mut hash)
        .map_err(|e| anyhow!("Argon2id hashing failed: {}", e))?;
    Ok(hash)
}
```
- Coin header and mining solution check:
```304:340:/Users/numan/unchained/src/miner.rs
let header = Coin::header_bytes(&anchor.hash, nonce, &creator_address);
let pow_hash = crypto::argon2id_pow(&header, mem_kib)?;
...
if pow_hash.iter().take(difficulty).all(|&b| b == 0) {
    ...
    let candidate = CoinCandidate::new(
        anchor.hash, nonce, creator_address, creator_pk, pow_hash,
    );
    ...
}
```
- Difficulty criterion is “leading zero bytes,” not bits. Memory parameter `mem_kib` is part of consensus and can be retargeted.

### Epoch coin selection
- The epoch manager collects all candidates whose `epoch_hash` matches the previous anchor, filters by the previous epoch’s difficulty requirement, then selects up to `max_coins_per_epoch` by smallest `pow_hash` (tie-break by `coin_id`), building a sorted-leaf BLAKE3 Merkle root:
```316:350:/Users/numan/unchained/src/epoch.rs
let required_difficulty = prev.difficulty;
candidates
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|c| c.pow_hash.iter().take(required_difficulty).all(|b| *b == 0))
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
...
// select top-k by smallest pow_hash, then sort top-k deterministically
```
- Retargeting adjusts both `difficulty` (up or down by 1 clamped in a range) and `mem_kib` based on average coins per epoch vs target:
```46:94:/Users/numan/unchained/src/epoch.rs
pub fn calculate_retarget(...) -> (usize, u32) { ... }
```
- Anchor hash = BLAKE3(merkle_root || prev.hash). Cumulative work is computed as `prev.cumulative_work + 2^(difficulty*8)`.

### Consensus and networking
- Anchor validation checks structure, the cumulative_work arithmetic, and the anchor hash linkage, but does not enforce that `difficulty` equals the deterministic retarget policy:
```193:221:/Users/numan/unchained/src/network.rs
fn validate_anchor(anchor: &Anchor, db: &Store) -> Result<(), String> {
    ...
    let prev: Anchor = db.get("epoch", &(anchor.num - 1).to_le_bytes())?.ok_or(...)?;
    let expected_work = Anchor::expected_work_for_difficulty(anchor.difficulty);
    let expected_cum = prev.cumulative_work.saturating_add(expected_work);
    if anchor.cumulative_work != expected_cum { return Err(...); }
    // Recompute anchor hash: BLAKE3(merkle_root || prev.hash)
    ...
}
```
- Reorg logic selects the branch with greater cumulative_work. There’s best-effort reconstruction of selected coins, but anchors are adoptable even if the local node cannot reconstruct their Merkle root (it will skip populating per-epoch indexes and continue).

### Transfers and stealth addresses
- Stealth address format exports `(recipient_addr, Dilithium pk, Kyber pk, signature over "stealth_addr_v1" || addr || kyber_pk)`. Parsing validates the sig and reconstructs the Kyber pk.
- V2 Spend: commits to the stealth output and includes a nullifier bound to the spending secret and coin id, plus a Merkle proof of inclusion. This replaces V1 entirely.

Key parts:
```362:513:/Users/numan/unchained/src/transfer.rs
pub struct Spend { coin_id, root, proof, commitment, nullifier, sig, to }
...
pub fn create(...) -> Result<Self> { ... }
pub fn validate(&self, db: &Store) -> Result<()> { ... }
```

```362:513:/Users/numan/unchained/src/transfer.rs
pub struct Spend { coin_id, root, proof, commitment, nullifier, sig, to }
...
pub fn create(...) -> Result<Self> {
    // to = new stealth output, commitment = H(to), nullifier = H_v2(spend_sk || coin_id), sig over auth_bytes
}
pub fn validate(&self, db: &Store) -> Result<()> {
    // coin exists; anchor exists; proof verifies; nullifier unseen; signature by current owner (one-time pk from last transfer, or creator pk for genesis); sanity of 'to'
}
```

- Wallet sending flow prefers V2 spends for each selected input, requests a coin proof from the network, determines the current owner secret key (last incoming stealth one-time SK or creator SK for genesis), creates and gossips the spend.

### Coins and data model
- `Coin` (confirmed): `id = blake3(epoch_hash || nonce || creator_address)`, `value: u64` (minted as 1), `epoch_hash`, `nonce`, `creator_address`, and `creator_pk` to enable genesis V2 spends. A `CoinCandidate` adds `pow_hash`.
```6:17:/Users/numan/unchained/src/coin.rs
pub struct Coin { id, value, epoch_hash, nonce, creator_address, creator_pk }
```

### Security audit: strengths and issues

- Strengths
  - Memory-hard Argon2id PoW with fixed lanes and deterministic salt prevents trivial parallelization changes.
  - Merkle proofs for per-epoch coin commitments; proof serving and verification are implemented end-to-end.
  - Stealth output uses Kyber768 KEM + AES-GCM-SIV with AAD binding to prevent ciphertext swapping; one-time Dilithium keys for recipients.
  - V2 spends hide sender pk and bind nullifier to the spend key and coin id; only the current owner can authorize spends.
  - Wallet uses Argon2id KDF with large memory for encryption; passphrase handling and zeroization included.

- Critical issues to fix urgently
  - Anchor difficulty not enforced by consensus rules:
    - Any peer can fabricate an anchor with arbitrarily high `difficulty` and consistent `cumulative_work`, and it will pass `validate_anchor` because only linkage and arithmetic are checked. This can instantly win cumulative work without doing any work, causing reorgs and chain takeover.
    - Anchor hash does not commit to `difficulty`, `mem_kib`, or `coin_count` fields, only `merkle_root` and parent hash, so even if you added checks later, tampering risks remain.
    - Required fixes:
      - Make anchor hash commit to the entire header (merkle_root, parent_hash, difficulty, mem_kib, epoch number, timestamp, etc.).
      - Enforce determinism of `difficulty`/`mem_kib` by recomputing retarget in `validate_anchor` and rejecting anchors that deviate from the rule.
      - Alternatively or additionally, introduce anchor-level PoW or compute cumulative work from actual selected coins’ PoW (e.g., sum of per-coin work derived from pow_hash) instead of a free-form `difficulty` field.
  - V2 genesis spend validation inconsistency:
    - `Spend::validate` supports genesis spends by verifying signature under `coin.creator_pk` when no previous transfer exists.
    - Network validator rejects genesis spends if there is no previous transfer:
```186:191:/Users/numan/unchained/src/network.rs
    } else {
        return Err("Cannot validate spend without previous owner pk (genesis spend requires legacy transfer)".into());
    }
```
    - Consequence: peers will reject wallet-generated V2 genesis spends that your local node accepts, causing divergence and censorship of genesis spends.
    - Fix: align `validate_spend` in `network.rs` with `Spend::validate` (allow creator_pk-based verification for genesis).

- Other observations and risks
  - Leading zero BYTES criterion is coarse; consider leading zero bits or thresholding on pow_hash interpreted as a large integer for smoother difficulty control.
  - Epochs are time-triggered; anchors themselves are not mined. Consider incentives/fees, anti-censorship for epoch production, and anchoring rate controls.
  - Memory retargeting (`mem_kib`) is configurable and adjusted per retarget window; abrupt changes can cause denial-of-service on low-memory miners. Clamp deltas tightly and announce transitions clearly in the anchor header (and commit them in the hash).
  - Selection fairness: picking the k smallest pow_hash among valid solutions is fine, but keep an eye on tie-breaking and candidate flooding. Per-epoch caps and filtering by prev difficulty are in place.

### Recommendations and roadmap
- Consensus hardening
  - Commit anchor header fields (difficulty, mem_kib, epoch number, maybe timestamp) into `anchor.hash`.
  - Validate retarget deterministically in `validate_anchor`; reject anchors with unexpected `difficulty`/`mem_kib`.
  - Consider anchor-level PoW or define cumulative work as a function of actually selected coins (e.g., sum of −log2(pow_hash/2^256) or equivalent).
  - Enforce minimum non-empty epochs after genesis to prevent empty-epoch grinding, or discount empty epochs in cumulative work.
- Transaction model
  - V2 spends only. Add fees and change outputs or coin-splitting to handle arbitrary amounts and reduce UTXO bloat if values >1 are used.
  - Add replay protection across reorgs: ensure nullifiers remain unique across forks (e.g., commit epoch root or anchor hash into nullifier preimage or nullifier set semantics).
- Privacy
  - For V1, sender_pk leaks identity. Encourage V2 by default and deprecate V1 in networking accept rules over time.
  - Consider decoy mechanisms or batching if stronger privacy is desired.
- Networking
  - Add signature checks for anchors by the producer if you introduce an anchor producer role, or keep strictly objective validation to avoid centralization.
  - Rate-limit and ban policies exist; keep telemetry on invalid anchors/coins to spot attacks.
- Wallet and UX
  - Encrypt and persist Kyber keys in the wallet file (the v2 format hint exists but isn’t used to store Kyber yet).
  - Improve input selection (avoid dust; consider deterministic ordering).
- Performance
  - Continue using offloaded blocking for Argon2; tune `mem_kib` ranges for typical hardware.

### Real use cases
- Micropayments with privacy: 1-value coins and stealth outputs suit streaming or small payments where each coin represents a discrete unit.
- Private asset transfers: Kyber+Dilithium stealth outputs with PQ security are future-proof for long-term confidentiality.
- Proof of useful work integration: the per-coin PoW model is amenable to swapping the header function or salt derivation for future “useful work” primitives while keeping selection logic.

### Quick answers to your focal questions
- PoW performed: Argon2id over header (prev epoch hash, nonce, creator address), lanes=1, salt from BLAKE3(header). Solution criterion: leading zero bytes equal to difficulty.
- Coin selection per epoch: from candidates referencing prev anchor, filter by prev difficulty, choose up to cap smallest pow_hash, commit their ids via a sorted-leaf BLAKE3 Merkle tree into the anchor.
- Transfers: V2 Spend proves coin inclusion, authorizes with current owner SK, commits to new stealth output, and publishes a nullifier to prevent double spends.
- Stealth addresses/transfers: Recipient publishes Dilithium+Kyber pair with a signed descriptor; sender KEM-encapsulates to recipient’s Kyber pk and delivers a one-time Dilithium key encrypted under AEAD; recipient decapsulates to recover the SK. Address for recipient is derived from the one-time pk.
- Coin structure: `Coin{id, value, epoch_hash, nonce, creator_address, creator_pk}`, minted with `value=1` by convention; `CoinCandidate` adds `pow_hash`.

- Most important fixes:
  - Enforce deterministic retarget in validation and commit difficulty/mem_kib into `anchor.hash`.
  - Align network spend validation with `Spend::validate` for genesis spends.
